## Setup
Airbnb has a publicly available repository of data on “Inside Airbnb” website, which records monthly snapshots of Airbnb datasets. The data for 16 cities from various parts of the world are collected based on the popularity of the cities for tourism. The rationale is that the effects of pandemic, as seen in the most popular cities, will impact Airbnb the most as well and hence, the change in customer attitudes from these cities will be representative of the expected impact to be seen in other regions where Airbnb has active operations. The selected cities for this study are:
 
1. Amsterdam 2. Bangkok 3. Barcelona 4. Hong Kong 5. Istanbul 6. London 7. Melbourne 8. New York 9. Paris 10. Porto 11. Rome 12. San Francisco 13. Singapore 14. Sydney 15. Madrid 16. Vienna
